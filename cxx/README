ON WINDOWS:
Download & build GYP manually (if you don't have it):
svn co http://gyp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk build/gyp
python build/gyp/setup.py install

Substitute step #1 below with:
build/gyp/gyp qudt4dt.gyp --depth=./


BUILD:
1.gyp qudt4dt.gyp --depth=./  -fmake    (or "-fmsvc" for vs2010, "fxcode" for Mac)
2.make


DEPENDENCY:
1.BOOST
2.libcurl
3.jsoncpp

For MSVS, the libcurl.dll is buggy and the better way is to use the static link, which means you need add all the lib files that below in ./lib/win to your project
