GETTING STARTED
This project is still pretty new, so there are a few different parts you will have to pull together to begin working.

There are two main things you might be interested in doing:
1) Use the database to convert quantities between units, and discover equivalent units across domain tools.
2) Re-generate the database, add new units, or add whole domains to the system.

Most people will only need #1.

DEPENDENCIES
To do #1 above:
- A Linux/Unix shell (Cygwin, Mac Terminal, etc) with the following installed:
	- Python 2.7.x
	- Requests for Python (http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install)
	- Java 6 or above (https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp)

To do #2 above:
- See #1, plus
- OpenModelica 1.9.x (to work with Modelica database)
- An ontology editor like:
	- Protege 4.x (for visualizing ontology databases)
	- TopBraid Composer (free)

RUNNING STUFF
- For #1:
	- run `build_ontologies.py` to load the raw data into the database. You only gotta do this once.
	- use the qudt4dt or C# libraries to do conversions, queries, etc.
		- run `start.sh` to get the server started first. It will be located at http://localhost:3030
		- You may need to modify the constructors to point the correct server location
- For #2:
	- UNDOCUMENTED WILD WEST. GOOD LUCK.
